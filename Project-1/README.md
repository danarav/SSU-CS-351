1. The results show that malloc.out had the fastest overall runtime in this test, performing slightly better than alloca.out, while list.out and new.out were noticeably slower. The faster performance of malloc.out is due to its use of efficient, low-level heap memory allocation with minimal overhead. In contrast, list.out relies on the C++ Standard Library’s std::list, which adds additional management overhead, and new.out includes constructor handling that also slows performance.
